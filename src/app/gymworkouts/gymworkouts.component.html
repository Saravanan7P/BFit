	<h1>Weight Training</h1>
	<p style="text-align:left;width: 600px;" >
		Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.It utilizes the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.<br>

Sports in which weight training is used are: bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: American football, baseball, basketball, canoeing, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, boxing and wrestling.</p>

<h1>Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="text-align:left;width: 600px;">
	Benefits of weight training include increased strength, muscle mass, endurance, bone and bone mineral density, insulin sensitivity, GLUT 4 density, HDL cholesterol, improved cardiovascular health and appearance, and decreased body fat, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

The body's basal metabolic rate increases with increases in muscle mass, which promotes long-term fat loss and helps dieters avoid yo-yo dieting. Moreover, intense workouts elevate metabolism for several hours following the workout, which also promotes fat loss.

Weight training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for joints, and reduce the risk of injury from everyday activities. Older people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies aging—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so, become less frail. They may be able to avoid some types of physical disability. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to increase bone density to prevent osteoporosis. The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their eighties and nineties.<br></p><br>

			<img style="margin-left: 100px;" src="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1109-Muscle-Fibers-bench-press.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><br><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				For many gym-goers, chest training starts and ends with the bench press. Or, if they’re not big on barbells, press-ups. Now those are both fantastic exercises, but for a truly pecs-tacular chest you need to extend your exercise repertoire. The good news is that below you’ll find a training plan containing a variety of chest exercises that will hit your muscles from different angles. Follow it to the letter and you’ll be the proud owner of a bigger, stronger chest in no time.<br>

You’ll be training four times a week throughout the four-week plan, but it won’t all be chest work. There’s little point in sculpting perfect pecs if the rest of your body doesn’t keep pace during that time. Two of your weekly workouts are chest-focused, while the other two are full-body training sessions.<br>

The chest sessions are workouts 1 and 3 on the plan and they differ in their approach to chest-building. The first session increases strength using a high number of sets but fewer reps. The second uses bodybuilding principles to form a workout where you do fewer sets but a higher number of reps with the aim of increasing size alongside strength.<br>

All four workouts are made up of five moves. The first two exercises are big, compound lifts done as normal sets. Go heavy with these and push yourself as hard as possible. Then the final three moves are a tri-set, so you rattle through the first set of 3A, then the first set of 3B, then the first set of 3C with minimal rest between them. Rest, then start the second sets. Do the workouts in order, sticking to the sets, reps, tempo and rest periods detailed, and you’ll add serious size and strength to your chest, while also building bigger arms and shoulders.<br>

The workout plan below really requires a gym, because it uses a barbell with weight plates, dumbbells, a weight bench, a rack and a pull-up bar. Unless your home gym is impressively well stocked, you might also want to check out the home chest workouts underneath the plan for something you can do when gyms are closed.</p><br>
			
			<h2>Chest Exercises</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Bench Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/bench_press_12-5-700xh.gif">
		
				<ul style="padding: 20px;">
					<li><b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> It's popular to hate on the bench press these days, but it's one of the most popular lifts in the gym for a reason. For one, the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is also relatively easy to spot—so don't be afraid to ask for one!</li>
						<li>
							The bench press also responds well to classic protocols like 5x5 for muscle and strength, or even 10x10, aka German Volume Training, for pure mass. If you want to get serious, there are systematic bench press programs like Bench 300 to help you chase a big number.
						</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>2.Dumbbell Bench Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 265px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/dumbbell-bench-press-header-830x467.jpg">
			
				<ul style="padding: 20px;">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is an age-old weight-room debate. Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation has more versatility throughout the beginning, middle, and end of a chest workout.</li>

 <li>Some other big plusses for dumbbells: Each side's musculature must work independently, creating more balanced strength and size. Dumbbells also allow a longer range of motion, which some studies say can lead to muscle growth. Plus, you can more easily tweak your grip to create variety and a new stimulus on chest day.</li>
		
				</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>3.Incline Bench Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 300px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/incline_bench_press_12-5-700xh.gif">
		
				<ul style="padding: 20px;">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Not only is the incline bench press a classic way to build the upper chest, many lifters find them to be a more comfortable "main lift" for the shoulders than flat benching. It's great with a barbell or multi-grip bar, but maybe be even better with dumbbells, since you can customize your grip to increase focus on the upper pecs.</li>

<li><b><i>Pro tip:</i></b> Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which EMG results have shown works the front delts as much as the chest. If possible, go for a lower incline, such as 30 degrees, to focus squarely on the upper pecs.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>4.Decline Bench Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 265px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/decline-bench-press-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding: 20px;">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> The common thinking on decline is that it's for lower chest only. And while it is good for that, all-time greats, like six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates in his 6-Week Blood and Guts program, favor it because it hits the entire chest and allows them to lift heavier and more comfortably than the flat bench.</li>

 <li>If your gym has a comfortable decline press machine, like a plate-loaded hammer strength machine, use it. Along with the traditional double-arm press, you can sit sideways and press across your body one arm at a time. This unilateral chest move emphasizes shoulder adduction, one of the primary actions of the pec major.</li>
		
				</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>5.Machine Fly:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 265px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/machine-fly-header-830x467.jpg">
			
				<ul style="padding: 20px;">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka, pec-deck) is a more effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. If your gym has one, it's a great move to get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk.<br>

But does it work? EMG data shows that activation of the pectoralis major is statistically similar between the machine fly and bench press, which means that even though you'll likely be working in different rep ranges for each exercise, both are worthy components to chest day. The big difference? For the machine, you don't need a spotter and can more safely push the intensity and reach true muscle failure.</li>

 <li><b><i>In your workout:</i></b> As a pre-exhaust, hit a few sets of 10-15 before your presses.As a burnout, hit the machine fly last in your routine for sets of around 10-12. Experiment with dropsets, partial reps, and other intensity boosters. Don't be afraid to take this movement to failure, and know that you've earned your post-workout protein shake.

</li>

			<h1 style="text-align:center">Back Workout in Gym</h1><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 170px" height="800px" width="1000px" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nhrgrnDTfrfsAPDiZWsDk6-1200-80.jpg"><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			
				When you crack your exercise toolkit open each week on back day, you've got a seemingly endless array of movements available. If you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of row variations, or you draw a total blank when thinking of new exercises to try, consider this list your new back blueprint.<br>

We took the science into account--and more. Head-to-head exercise comparison research is a bit limited, and often misleading. 
			<br>
			<h2>Back Exercises:</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Deadlift:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/abel_30-day_deadlift_loop_700x394_12-5-700xh.gif">
	
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the entire posterior chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside development.</li><br>

<li>And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big.</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>2.Lat Pull Down:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/lat-pull-down-header-v2-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Your first impulse may be to reach for the wide-grip bar, but back-focused EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip. This grip also allows for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle.</li><br>

<li>Slow down the rep tempo on these, squeeze hard at the bottom of each rep, and allow a good stretch at the top..</li>
<li><b><i>In your workout:</i></b> When used as a mass-building exercise, it's best placed toward the middle or end of your workout for sets of 8-12 reps. It's great as a pump-focused finishing move, as well..</li>
					
				</ul>
			
			<h2>3.T-Bar Row:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/t-bar-row-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the entire posterior chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside development.</li><br>

<li>And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big.</li>
					
				</ul>
		
			<h2>4.Row-To-Grow Back Workout:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/row-to-grow-back-day-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						If you want width, you must row. This workout is great on its own, but is also an ideal approach if you like to do two back days a week, one focused more on horizontal pulls, the other on vertical pulls. That's the approach taken in the popular program 30-Day Back with Abel Albonetti.</li><br>
					
				</ul>
			
			<h2>5.Hard And Heavy Back Workout:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:300px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/hard-and-heavy-back-workout-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						This is a classic "clangin' and bangin''' back day focused on heavy compound movements, but finishing with high-rep pull-overs. It's the perfect main course before switching to a quick pump-focused biceps workout for dessert.</li>

			<h1 style="text-align:center">Biceps Workout in Gym</h1><br>
			<img style=" width: 1300px;" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/Network/Images/MASSIVE-GUNZ-16048.jpg"><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
		
				Over the years, a number of studies have sought to investigate the best biceps exercises. This shouldn't surprise you! You know the first thing you'd do if you ever got access to an EMG machine would be to hook it up to your guns. Be honest.<br>

So, what's the winner? Based on biceps EMG alone, it's usually the concentration curl, a staple in the bodybuilding regimens of golden-era lifters like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. But here's the catch: We've never met a single bodybuilder who whole-heartedly agreed.
			<br>
			<h2>Biceps Exercise</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Barbell Or EZ-Bar Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/standing-barbell-curl-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads of the biceps equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working one arm at a time.</li><br>

<li>How many more reasons do you need? If you're only going to do one biceps exercise, make it this one.

Want to use a straight bar instead of a cambered EZ-bar? Have at it, if your wrists don't mind. A 2018 study found that while both variants produced greater activity than dumbbell curls, "The small difference between [barbell] and EZ variants… makes the choice between these two exercises a matter of subjective comfort."</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Hit your heavy curls at the beginning of your biceps workout when you can really challenge yourself with weight. For a bit more of a strength stimulus, choose a weight you can handle for about 6-8 reps, or even a classic size-and-strength rep range like 5x5. A common biceps blunder is rocking your body excessively on this movement. Keep it strict for the most part, especially when you're going heavy.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>2.Dumbbell Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/dumbbell-curl-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That's up to you. Sure, you can do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don't recommend it. The real value of dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or alternating, rotating your wrists into Zottman curls to work on your fearsome forearms, or twisting that pinky up to focus purely on the bis. In short, you have options.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> If you're doing these after barbell or cable curls, emphasize the difference by performing Zottmans, or take bilateral seated curls to fatigue and then extend the set by switching to unilateral curls.

If you feel your reps getting sloppy, really hammer the negatives. It's been shown that the eccentric-focused reps can produce higher levels of force than the concentric, even when you're fatigued.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>3.Hammer Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/rope-hammer-curl-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Hammer curls are usually done in the middle or at the end of a workout in a classic rep range of 8-12 reps. Experiment with isometric holds to create a deep burn that even the pros fear.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>4.Preacher Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/preacher-curl-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> There are many versions of the preacher curl, and every serious physique builder has their fave. Whatever version you do, you'll get a serious pump, particularly if you have a quality pre-workout or pump supplement coursing through your bloodstream at the time. In fact, this old-school peak-builder can be nearly enough for an entire biceps workout, perhaps with something like hammer curls added to it.</li><br>
						<li>
							As with other movements that start from a stretched position, you get the most muscle activation during the lower third of the movement. As the weight moves up, the muscle doesn't have to work as hard. This is one reason the cable might be the best implement to use here to help complete your biceps.


						</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Since your arms are against a bench, it's a very strict movement that doesn't allow a lot of cheating. Hence, this movement is best done toward the latter half of your workout for at least 8-12 reps per set.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>5.Concentration Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/concentration-curl-header-v2-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Hey, there's a reason the concentration curl fares so well on muscle-activation studies. One reason is that the torso position limits shoulder involvement, but another might be the mind-muscle connection many people report experiencing with this move. There is actually some emerging evidence surrounding the ability of the mind-muscle connection to help increase muscle growth.

</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> This is best treated as a light, strict move to finish off your biceps when you're already somewhat fatigued. Pick a weight just heavy enough that you're failing around 10-12 reps.
</li>
				
				</ul>

			<h1 style="text-align:center">Triceps Workout in Gym</h1><br>
			<img style=" width: 1300px;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0327/8461/3514/articles/triceps-workouts_1024x.jpg?v=1607815837"><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
	
				The triceps make up roughly two-thirds of your upper arm, so if you want bigger arms, building your tris is a must. The problem is, every lifter has a different approach. Some simply perform all manner of push-downs, while others spend an hour parked at the dumbbell rack. Which is better? Well, it depends on what move you're trying to do there.<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Triceps Exercise</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Skullcrusher:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/ez-bar-skullcrusher-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> This move—also known as a lying triceps extension—hammers two of the three heads of the triceps: the long and lateral heads. The most popular version is performed on a flat bench with the elbows locked over the head (hence the name), but it's also great on a decline or incline bench. It also works with a wide variety of resistance including not only an EZ-bar, but also dumbbells, cables, or even the Smith machine. The article, "Your Complete Guide to Skullcrushers" gives plenty of options to choose from.</li><br><li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> After warming up your elbows, perform 3-4 sets for 8-12 reps as the first or second exercise in your routine. Don't be a hero and risk your skull! Hit your reps and it'll help you build tris to match your bis.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>2.Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/seated-triceps-press-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Once your arms go overhead, the long head of the triceps gets prioritized. This head is difficult to target otherwise, which is why it's always a good idea to include some kind of overhead exercise in your triceps workout.<br>

Luckily, you have options! You can go one arm or two, seated or standing, and if you have a partner, you can go heavy and do some forced reps.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Do your extensions toward the second half of your workout, after heavier movements, for around 3 sets of 8-10 reps. Concentrate on getting a good stretch during the eccentric portion of the lift as you lower the weight.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>3.Cable Overhead Extension With Rope:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/cable-overhead-triceps-ext-header-830x467.jpg">
	
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Like dumbbell overhead work, cable overhead presses focus on the often underdeveloped long head. The constant tension provided by the cable might actually make this a better choice than dumbbells if you're picking between the two.<br></li><li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> This is a great second or third exercise in place of push-downs if you do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>4.Triceps Machine Dip:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/triceps-dip-machine-header-830x467.jpg">
	
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>This compound exercise makes it especially easy to pick and change weights for different rep ranges. This makes it easy to do forced reps, dropsets, or even rest-pause sets to boost your intensity.</li><br>
						<li>
							<b><i>Pro tip:</i></b> Many trainees mess up here by failing to go to full triceps extension and stopping short of fully bending their elbows. Your triceps are elbow extenders, so perform the full range of motion.
						</li><br><li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Do this early or in the middle of your workout for 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps, and you'll be convinced this is one of the best arm muscle-building machines out there. Alternately, up the reps to double digits as an upper-arm burnout.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>5.Cable Push-Down:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/cable_rope_push_down-700xh.gif">
	
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>For many lifters, this is the quintessential triceps burnout move, and for good reason. It effectively targets the lateral head, is easy to perform—just don't let your arms drift from your sides!—and lends itself easily to dropsets.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Since this is a single-joint or "isolation" exercise, do it toward the end of your workout for 3 sets of 10-12 reps or slightly higher.
</li>

Too many have tried to make that claim, and it's just not the case. The truth is, carving the perfect six-pack requires a variety of exercises and months if not years of consistent work.<br>

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try! It just means you need to get moving. We've put together a full slate of top-level choices for building your abs, in no particular order, along with a brief explanation of what makes each one great and—when available—the research to back them up.  

<br>
		
			<h2>Abs Exercises</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Hanging Knee Raise:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/weighted_hanging_crunch-700xh.gif">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>There are many reasons to like leg raises, but top of the list is their scalability. You can start doing bent-knee raises in a captain's chair or with ab straps to focus on the lower core, work up to straight-leg raises, and then move to a hanging bar. By the time you're doing full straight-leg toes-to-bar raises, you've built unparalleled strength in your entire core.<br>

Another point in their favor: You can increase the degree of difficulty and resistance by holding a medicine ball between your knees or ankles, allowing you to train in a lower rep range. Or you can add a twist at the top or graduate to full-blown "windshield wipers" to target your deeper rotational muscles and obliques.<br>

No matter the variation, just remember to use your abs, not momentum, to get your legs as high as possible on each rep.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Do this move first or second in your routine for 3 sets of 10-15 reps, or however many reps you can do. If using a medicine ball, try a dropset simply by letting go of the medicine ball when you hit failure.
</li>
				
				</ul>
		
			<h2>2.Machine Crunch:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/machine-crunch-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Ab exercises with added resistance don't get enough love! Extra resistance spurs growth in the fast-twitch muscle fibers like almost nothing else and can really build up the "bricks" of your six-pack.<br>

By using a machine, you can also adjust the load and train to failure at just about any rep target you want. A pin-loaded machine works especially well when doing dropsets. If your gym doesn't have a dedicated ab machine, you can still get the same benefits using cables or bands.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> This works great as one of the first exercises in your ab routine. Use a challenging weight for a lower rep target. Of course, it also works with lighter weight as a burnout at the end. In either case, 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps is a solid formula.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>3.Cable Crunch:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/cable-crunch-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>The strength of this exercise is its versatility. It works for any fitness level, on any cable machine, and you can add any amount of resistance you need to train at your target rep range. You can also use a resistance band if you don't have a cable stack handy.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> This is another good first or second exercise that can be done for a low-to-moderate number of reps. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps. If you want to add a dropset, change the pin or use a lighter resistance band when you reach muscle failure and immediately perform another 8-10 reps.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>4.Decline Crunch:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/incline_abs_crunch-700xh.gif">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>This old-school fave amps up the ab engagement by increasing the range of motion over standard crunches. You can also dial up—or down—the degree of difficulty by adjusting the angle of the bench.<br>

Holding a medicine ball, dumbbell, or plate against your chest adds a further level of customizable resistance. If you want the ab-chiseling upside of cables or gym machines but don't have access to a gym, this is for you.<br>

Be warned: Since your feet are hooked, it's all too easy to use your hip flexors to come up instead of your abs. Keep your lower back flat to the bench and your abs engaged. If you're not feeling a wicked burn, drop all the weight, put your hands on your belly, and really focus on the contraction at a slower pace.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Position this one later in your routine after you've built up some fatigue from a really challenging first exercise or two. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps. If you find 15 reps too easy, simply increase the angle of decline or use a heavier ball or plate.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>5.Plank:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/plank-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Muscle activation studies consider the plank a mid-level exercise. But in this case, that doesn't tell the whole story. It's first and foremost a great transverse abdominis move, but that muscle is deep, so can't be measured by EMG.<br>

Planks primarily made the list because of how easily you can use different variations to change the level of difficulty. If an elbow plank is too difficult, perform it with the arms straight or simply drop to your knees. Too easy? Lift an arm or a leg—or an arm and a leg. Put your feet into suspension straps or on a stability ball. Each one of these progressions leads to a greater training stimulus to the abs.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> You can do these last on ab day, but you can also do them at home just about any time you want. Since it's an isometric move, shoot for time rather than reps. Doing 3-5 sets of 30-90 seconds in whatever variation is toughest for you should get you shaking!
</li>

			<h1 style="text-align:center">Leg Workout in Gym</h1><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 180px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/june/5-leg-workouts-for-mass-header-v2-960x540.jpg"><br><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
		
				Successful leg mass building relies on a 4-point rule. First, you must start the workout with the most strenuous exercises and the heaviest weights. Second, you have to hit the thighs from different angles. Third and fourth, you need to keep every routine’s volume high and train to muscle failure.<br>

With so many choices of how to train the lower body, it's no wonder that so many lifters feel overwhelmed and skip leg day entirely. (That's your excuse, right?)<br>
It’s always tempting to skip leg day, mostly because no-one enjoys the DOMS that tends to follow, but no weight training plan is complete without at least one leg-focused workout a week. So to ensure you’re never struggling for ideas of exercises to do on leg day, we spoke to Andy Page, strength and conditioning coach at the new Pure Sports Medicine Chancery Lane clinic.

Here are Page’s top leg exercises for beginner, intermediate and advanced gym-goers, and a few of our favourites too.

		
			<br>
			<h2>Leg Exercises</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Barbell Front Squat:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/barbell-front-squat-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Shifting the bar from the back to the front of the body changes your squat dramatically. Front squats emphasize the quads over the glutes and hams, which means you'll sacrifice some of the load. It also helps you maintain a more vertical torso position, which can help increase squat depth and perhaps decrease the risk of lower back injury.<br>

Front squats also demand—and build—serious upper back and core strength. Those benefits also apply to variations like dumbbell front squats and goblet squats. Think you're too strong for goblets? Strength coach and physical therapist John Rusin requests that you do half your body weight for 20 reps and reconsider. </li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> These are brutally hard, so do them first, when your energy levels are highest, for 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps. Favor the lower end if you're looking to build strength.  
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>2.Split Squat:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/smith_single-leg_split_squat-700xh.gif">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Done right, split squats—particularly rear-foot-elevated or "Bulgarian" split squats—are devastating to your legs. In fact, EMG evidence suggests that 4 sets using your 10-rep max with Bulgarians create similar quad activation to back squats. The same study also found similar testosterone responses between Bulgarians and back squats!<br>

Nevertheless, split squats are deceptively difficult, partly because of balance and partly because you're training one side at a time. And when you raise your rear foot in a so-called Bulgarian split squat, everything gets tougher. If balance is holding you back, you can just drop your back foot, hold onto a stable object, or even perform them in the Smith machine. </li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> These work best toward the middle of a leg session. Do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps per leg, and go for close to muscular failure on each set. If you really want to bring up the intensity, try bodyweight Bulgarians with blood flow restriction (BFR). 
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>3.Leg Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/leg-press-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b> Leg press vs. squat is a classic weight-room debate, but one that misses the point. Strength coach and physical therapist John Rusin explains why in his article, "Don't Do High-Rep Squats, Deads, and Bench! Do These Instead." Squats are for doing early in a leg workout and going heavy, he explains, and leg presses are for doing afterward for high reps. Sounds like a recipe for leg growth to us!<br>

Like hack squats, the leg press allows for a variety of foot positions to target the outer quads, inner quads, glutes, or hamstrings. Just be careful not to lower the sled too far! This common mistake will lift your glutes up off the butt pad and cause your lower spine to curl. A rounded back puts you at risk for an injury. </li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> You can't go wrong with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Occasionally, when the pre-workout is flowing, do a few epic sets of 20-30 reps or more. This exercise also goes exceptionally well with intensity-boosting techniques such as rest-pause, dropsets, or forced reps.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>4.Leg Curl:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/leg-curl-header-830x467.jpg">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>  What makes this single-joint machine move worthy of being listed among squats and deadlifts? Because too many lifters think those two exercises are "enough" for their hamstrings. They're definitely not!<br>

In his article, "A Scientific Approach to Hamstring Training," muscle-building expert Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D., conclusively makes the case that for balanced, strong hamstrings you need curls, too. Specifically, the lower hamstrings are activated dramatically more during seated leg curls than deadlifts—even stiff-legged deadlifts.<br>

You wouldn't skip curls during an arm workout, would you? Don't make the same mistake for your legs.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Keep it simple: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, coming close to muscle failure. This is a low-risk, high-reward move, so occasionally add in some slow negatives or dropsets to make it more intense.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>5.Hack Squat:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/hack-squat-header-830x467.jpg">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>  A knock against machine-based leg exercises is that the hormone boost they generate just doesn't compare to free weights. But that's not a reason not to do them! It just means do them later in your leg workout when you're already fatigued.<br>

One of the primary benefits of the hack squat is that you can manipulate foot placement, which is why fitness model Julian "The Quad Guy" Smith considers them one of his signature moves for legs. A high placement allows you to descend farther, which emphasizes the glutes and hamstrings. A lower placement means the quads take up a greater percentage of the workload.<br>

It's also easier to use advanced intensity techniques like forced reps and dropsets, because you can change weight quickly and aren't balancing a barbell.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Hack squats are typically done after free-weight exercises and before single-joint leg movements. The sweet spot is somewhere around 3 sets of 8-12 reps, although if you're following a program built by a hack devotee like Kris Gethin in his 8-Week Hardcore training plan, you can expect that to go up to 20-30 reps and beyond. Consider yourself warned!

			<h1 style="text-align:center">Shoulder Workout in Gym</h1><br>
			<img style="margin-left: 180px;" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2018/december/bigger-shoulders-in-just-20-minutes-header2-960x540.jpg"><br><br>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			
				The way lifters train their shoulders is usually a balance of personal taste and injury history. Is putting heavy weight overhead the ultimate goal? Or does it make you wince just thinking about it? Are raises your bread and butter, or are they a low-priority accessory lift?<br>

If you've read the other articles in the 10 Best series, you know we favor a little of both: a heavy muscle-building move like a press to start, followed by targeted isolation work after. This approach is a time-tested way to build the best shoulder workouts for both men and women. And it allows you to utilize a wide range of movements! Here's how we selected ours:<br>

<ul style="padding:20px"><li>Ease of learning and performing</li><br>
<li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li><br>
<li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li><br>
<li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li><br></ul>
You'll find enough variations of each movement below to keep you busy for a long time. Read up, eat to grow, then get to work with the three complete workouts below!
			
			<br>
			<h2>Shoulder Exercises</h2><br>
			<h2>1.Push-Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/bb_push_press-700xh.gif">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>This press allows you to load up more weight, and do more reps, than just about any other overhead exercise, making it a great way to unlock new shoulder growth. It's rightfully considered a bit more of a whole-body movement than a pure shoulder move, since your lower body, core, delts, triceps, and upper pecs are all involved.<br>

This isn't always a bad thing! Compound movements like this engage a great deal of muscle mass and boost muscle-building hormones better than movements that don't. It's a favorite of bodybuilders who are looking to build strength and athleticism in the offseason, like in Steve Cook's shoulder and arms workout.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> This doesn't need to be an "every workout" move. When you do use it, perform it first in your workout, after warming up well, for 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps. Stop each set before fatigue causes your form to crack. 
</li>
				
				</ul>
							<h2>2.Rear Delt Row:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/dumbbell_rear_delt_row-700xh.gif">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>What the heck is a row doing in an article about shoulder exercises? Remember, rowing movements don't just work the "back," they involve the rear delts to a significant degree, as well. And experts like physical therapist John Rusin, creator of the BodyFit resource Unstoppable: The Ultimate Guide to Training Through Injury, believe that a key to shoulder health is rowing twice or even three times as much as you press.<br>

One more point in favor of rows, particularly on an incline bench: a 2014 study found that in addition to hitting the rear delts as well as flyes, they activated the middle delt significantly better than dumbbell shoulder presses, cable lateral raises, and even barbell upright rows. This makes it a no-brainer for creating a time-efficient shoulder workout.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> As part of a shoulder workout, do this immediately after press variations for sets of 8-10, or as a final high-rep movement for sets of 10-12 or more.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>3.Seated Barbell Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/seated_bb_shoulder_press-700xh.gif">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Using a barbell rather than dumbbells may seem like a matter of taste, but there are functional reasons to pick the big bar. For one, you can put a bench in a rack and press off of the safety pins, allowing you to dial in your desired range of motion. Doing barbell-style presses on a Smith machine also allows you to safely push a bit closer to failure than other press variations and really focus on performing slow negatives.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> Do these first in your workout and use challenging weights for sets of 6-8 reps. That's how bodybuilder Lawrence Ballenger starts his Boulder Shoulder workout before moving on to lighter lifts.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>4.Arnold Press:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/arnold_press_1-700xh.gif">
			
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>Yes, this is just a dumbbell press with some rotation added in. Why give it a separate callout? Because the namesake of the move was definitely onto something!<br>

Research has shown that the staple move of old-school muscle-building programs like the Blueprint to Mass hits both the front and medial delts more than other dumbbell press variations. Plus, many lifters simply find it more friendly to their shoulder joints. That's a big one-two punch.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b> These are great first in your workout, or second after a more basic overhead press. Consider pyramiding up in weight and down in reps for 4 sets of 12, 10, 8, and 6, like in the 3-Move Shoulder Builder workout.
</li>
				
				</ul>
			
			<h2>5.Front Raise:</h2><br><br>
			<img style="margin-left:270px" src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/front-dumbbell-raise-header-830x467.jpg">
		
				<ul style="padding:20px">
					<li>
						<b><i>Why it's on the list:</i></b>The "why" of this move is simple enough: raising your straight arm directly in front of you activates the anterior head of your deltoids. But it's not a must-do for everyone! Presses hammer the anterior delts, and these muscles already tend to be disproportionately large among individuals who overdo chest training compared to back training.<br>

So, if you're only going to do one variation, which one is best? Single-sided dumbbell or cable raises are great because each side works independently, or alternating. This maximizes the mind-muscle connection, but also helps to build balanced shoulders.</li><br>
<li>
	<b><i>In your workout:</i></b>If you're going to do it, do it in the second half of your shoulder workout. It's a great last movement for a burnout, especially superset with lateral raises, as in Abel Albonetti's Brutal Mass-Building Shoulder Workout.
</li>
