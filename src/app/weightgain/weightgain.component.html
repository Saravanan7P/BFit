		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>If you want to gain weight, then it is very important that you do it right. Binging on soda and donuts may help you gain weight, but it can destroy your health at the same time. If you are underweight, then you want to gain a balanced amount of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat, not a bunch of unhealthy belly fat. There are plenty of normal weight people who get type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other health problems often associated with obesity. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that you still eat healthy foods and live an overall healthy lifestyle. It is very important to eat mostly healthy foods even if you are trying to gain weight. If you want to gain weight slowly and steadily, then aim for 300-500 calories more than you burn each day according to the calculator. If you want to gain weight fast, then aim for something like 700-1000 calories above your maintenance level. Keep in mind that calorie calculators only provide estimates. Your needs may vary by several hundred calories per day, give or take. You don't need to count calories for the rest of your life, but it helps to do it for the first few days/weeks to get a feel for how many calories you are eating.</p>

<h2>Food Items You Can Easily Consume in Diet plan of weigh gain</h2>
<ol style="padding:10px"><li>Lean Red Meat: Steak contains a ton of protein and iron. Red meat is high in cholesterol, so most food professionals don’t recommend it as part of a healthy diet more than a few times per week.
</li><li>Real Nut Butters: Natural peanut butter is packed with protein and fats, making it a great choice for people trying to gain weight the healthy way. One tablespoon contains around 100 calories and has 4 grams of protein.
</li><li>Whole Fat Milk: Dietitians say that one simple substitution you can make when trying to gain weight is swapping your skim milk for whole milk. It’s only 60 calories more a glass as the fat is left in.
</li><li>Tropical Fruit: Fruits like mango, papaya, bananas, and pineapple are amazing choices according to food experts. They are full of natural sugars and can give you great energy.
</li><li>Avocado: These delicious green vegetables are an excellent way to add heart-healthy fats to your diet. One half of an avocado contains 140 calories, but also contain high levels of potassium, folic acid, and vitamin E. 
</li><li>Natural Granola: Natural granola with no added refined sugar is a great cereal to enjoy if you are trying to gain weight. This tasty snack is made from rolled oats, sugar, and healthy fats (like nuts and coconut oil). More dried fruit and nuts can also be added.
</li><li>Whole Wheat Bread: Nutritionists say that eating healthy bread products is a great way to start gaining weight. If you’re adding bread to your diet, look for whole grains.
</li><li> Nuts: Nuts are a great snack for gaining weight. They are full of fat and nutrients, but also contain a great deal of fiber. Eating only a handful of nuts can keep you full for hours. Not all nuts are equal for fiber though.
</li><li>Cheese: Try goat cheese with eggs, Swiss with roasted chicken, and Parmesan on top of asparagus. On its own, cheese also makes a great snack because it’s high in protein.</li></ol>
