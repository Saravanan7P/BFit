			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Aerobic exercise (also known as endurance activities, cardio or cardio-respiratory exercise) is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. "Aerobic" is defined as "relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen", and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Aerobic exercise is performed by repeating sequences of light-to-moderate intensity activities for extended periods of time. Aerobic exercise may be better referred to as "solely aerobic", as it is designed to be low-intensity enough that all carbohydrates are aerobically turned into energy via mitochondrial ATP production. Mitochondria are organelles that rely on oxygen for the metabolism of carbs, proteins, and fats.<br>

Examples of cardiovascular or aerobic exercise are medium- to long-distance running or jogging, swimming, cycling, stair climbing and walking.<br></p>

	Benefits Of Cardio Exercise:</h2>
	<p><b>
Burning fat is a wonderful byproduct of cardio exercise, but there are many other great benefits of getting your cardio on:</b></p>
<ul style="padding:20px"><li><b><i>
Keeps your heart healthy:</i></b> By getting your heart rate up consistently, you’ll keep your heart strong and decrease your risk of heart disease and other problematic conditions. To improve overall cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise.</li><br>
<li><b><i>Boosts your mood:</i></b> Cardiovascular exercise causes your brain to release endorphins, the feel-good chemicals responsible for balancing your mood and keeping depressive thoughts at bay. Many people cite beginning an exercise regimen as one step they’ve taken to help their overall mental health. Even a brisk walk can noticeably alter your attitude.</li><br>
<li><b><i>Boosts Your Immunity:</i></b> Cardio exercise in most environments makes your immune system stronger, helping you to reduce your body’s risk of bacterial infection and prevent disease.</li><br>
<li><b><i>Helps Your Circulation:</i></b> Cardiovascular exercise improves your blood circulation, which helps your body rid itself of toxins better and keeps you healthy. Poor circulation long-term can lead to problems such as heart attack or stroke, but keeping your circulation functioning properly can help prevent those problems.</li><br>
<li><b><i>Boosts Your Weight Loss:</i></b> Finally—cardiovascular exercise helps to burn calories, and when it comes to weight loss, calories still matter. You have to expend more calories than you take in to lose weight. Along with strength training, cardio should be a main aspect of your weight loss journey.</li></ul>

<h1>1.Walking[300-400 Calories/hour]</h1><br>
<img style="margin-left:350px; width:600px; height: 400px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/walking.jpg?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1"><br>
<p>
	Yes, walking! Perhaps the simplest, most available exercise around, walking is not only a great way to burn calories, but it’s also a low-impact workout that most people can do.<br>

However, a leisurely evening stroll won’t make the cardio cut. In order to burn fat you need a brisk, moderately-fast pace. According to the Mayo Clinic, regular brisk walking can help you:</p>
<ul style="padding:30px;">
	<li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
<li>Prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Strengthen your bones and muscles</li>
<li>Improve your mood</li>
<li>Improve your balance and coordination</li>
</ul><br>
The faster, farther and more frequently you walk, the greater the benefits. You can walk outdoors on the sidewalk, go for a hike, or hit the treadmill at the gym. <br>

<b><i>Tip:</i></b> If you’re using a treadmill, try adding an incline to torch more calories and tone your glutes and thighs. 
<br>
<h1>2.Running Stairs [1000 calories/hour]</h1><br>
<img style="margin-left:350px; width:600px; height: 400px;" src="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/man-running-stairs-1109.jpg?quality=86&strip=all">
<p>
	A simple flight of stairs is about to be your new favorite workout tool. Walking, sprinting, or lunging up a flight of stairs provides a great big calorie burn. A 150-lb person running stairs for an hour can burn 1000 calories! 

The good news is: you don’t have to sprint stairs for an hour to see the benefits. A person weighing 160 lbs. will burn 102 calories simply walking up and down stairs for 10 minutes. Even better, you can do a great cross-training workout in 30 minutes or less and burn off more than a regular running session.<br>

Look for an outdoor staircase near you that has more than one flight, or hop on the stair climber at the gym. For a home workout, you can simply run or walk up a flight of stairs in your home instead. <br>

<h1>3.Kettlebells [800-900 calories/hour]</h1><br>
<img style="margin-left:350px; width:600px; height: 400px;" src="https://evofitness.at/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EVO-2020-PP-APRIL-Banner_01-1200x675.jpg">

	A kettlebell is a cannonball-shaped weight that produces a powerful, effective workout. Kettlebell workouts combine strength training with cardio, and can help you burn up to 20 calories per minute (the equivalent to running a 6-minute mile.) Now that’s getting the most from your workout time!<br><br>

According to the American Council on Exercise, kettlebells can provide a higher intensity workout than the usual strength training routine in a shorter amount of time. This is because kettlebell training simultaneously works your cardio endurance while building muscle strength, balance and flexibility.<br><br>

Try our 10-minute kettlebell workout for a great introduction on how to use kettlebells, as well as a powerful 10-minute workout.

<h1>4.Jumping Rope [600 calories/hour]</h1><br>
<img style="margin-left:350px; width:600px; height: 400px;" src="https://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/mf/jumprope-1280.jpg?w=1200&h=960&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all">
<p>
	One of the best cardio exercises for weight loss is jumping rope. It’s not only a calorie blaster but helps build bone density, strengthens your legs and makes your heart stronger. <br><br>

<b><i>Fun fact:</i></b> you’d have to run an eight-minute mile to work off more calories than you can burn jumping rope. An additional bonus is that, if done properly, this exercise is lower impact than running.<br><br>

Jumping rope is also a great form of plyometric workout, where both feet are off the ground. Plyometrics get your heart pumping and burn calories quickly and effectively. Other forms of plyometrics include exercises like:</p>
<ul style="padding:30px">
<li>Jumping jacks</li>
<li>Split jumps</li>
<li>Box jumps (you can use any step or safe, elevated platform)</li></ul>
If jumping rope sounds like a fun way to incorporate cardio into your routine, check out this 15 minute jump rope and bodyweight workout to try at home or the gym. 

<h1>5.Cycling [600 calories/hour]</h1><br>
<img style="margin-left:350px; width:600px; height: 400px;" src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/70466740.cms">
<p>
	Remember when you were a kid and riding your bike was the best part of the day? Good news: it’s great for adults, as well!<br>

Cycling is a low-impact exercise which increases your heart health, strengthens your leg muscles and burns some serious calories. Outdoor cycling also fills your need for fresh air and vitamin D.<br>

But not everyone feels comfortable biking outside or has the financial means to purchase a brand new bike. If that’s the case, indoor cycling is an excellent option. According to The American Council of Sports Medicine, an average person burns between 400-600 calories in a 45-minute class.
